Packer automatically gathers your items for you.  You can use the following commands:

/packer gear [File]
-Starts automatic gearing
-If you have Ashitacast loaded, you can trigger this on your currently loaded XML by typing: /ac gear
-File must be located in ashitacast config folder, or full path including drive letter must be specified.
-Filename should not contain quotes, spaces are ok.
Example: /packer gear C:\Ashita 3\Config\Ashitacast\Thorny_MNK.xml
Example: /packer gear Thorny_MNK.xml

/packer stop

/packer load default
-Loads a configuration XML located it ashitaroot/config/packer/.  Packer will always look for default.xml in that directory on load and load it.

Settings information is located in the Settings Structure.xml file.   Configuration is very similar to dressme, but plugin is MUCH faster.
